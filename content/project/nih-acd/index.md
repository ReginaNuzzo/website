title: NIH Advisory Committee to the Director Working Group on Enhancing Rigor, Transparency, and Translatability in Animal Research

summary:  Our working group was charged with advising NIH how it can help researchers improve the rigor, transparency, and reproducibility of NIH research involving animals, paying close attention to the late stages of the translational pipeline that produce new treatments for human health and disease. The overarching goal is to allow all stakeholders to have full confidence in the quality and applicability of research findings from animal studies and to ensure that animal subjects are used with appropriate consideration of ethics and harmâ€“benefit analysis.
