title: "SciLine's Quick Facts: Surveys and Polling"
summary:  Opinion polls vary enormously in structure, style, and credibility, and are easy to mis- or overinterpret. At their best, opinion polls can give an accurate snapshot of broad public sentiment on an issue. But even well-constructed polls are not particularly good at measuring small shifts in opinions over time, and their ability to predict future voter choices is decidedly mixed. Among other confounders for voter polls, people often hold off before settling on a candidateâ€”and even then they often change their minds. The following primer provides some essentials for accurate reporting on polls and surveys. Joint product of the American Statistical Association and AAAS's SciLine.
