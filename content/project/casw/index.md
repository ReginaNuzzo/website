title: Asking Questions About Data
summary:   A collaboration with statistician-science writers Regina Nuzzo and Kristin Sainani and funding from the Kavli Foundation enabled the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing to pilot-test a video mini-course, “Asking Questions About Data,” in the fall of 2022. Presenting case studies in a lively podcast-style debate format reinforced with problem sets that students could complete at their own pace, the two instructors showed journalists how to spot spin, fraud, and sloppy work and explain the strengths and weaknesses of new scientific results.
