Dr. Regina Nuzzo is a freelance science writer and professor in Washington, DC. After studying engineering as an undergraduate, she earned her [PhD
in Statistics from Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu). Currently she's a Professor teaching Statistics in American Sign Language at [Gallaudet University](https://www.gallaudet.edu), the world's only university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and a part-time Lecturer at Stanford University, where she co-teaches a course for the [Masters in Clinical Informatics Management program](https://med.stanford.edu/master-clinical-informatics-management.html) in the School of Medicine.

Dr. Nuzzo is also a graduate of [Science Communication program at the University of

appeared in _Nature_, _Los Angeles Times_, _New York Times_, _Reader’s Digest_,
_New Scientist_, and _Scientific American_, among others. Her feature article on p-values in _Nature_ earned the American Statistical Association’s 2014 Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award. 

Dr. Nuzzo has been invited to speak around the world to a variety of audiences
about her work, such as why we just can't understand p-values, how our brain can fool us during data analysis, what happens when people abuse and misuse statistics, and tips and tricks for communicating anything with numbers and statistics.
