# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "So what exactly is a p-value?' That’s the number-one question I get from non-scientists when they hear my specialty is communicating p-values and other statistics. (The second question is usually something like, 'Who cares?'' followed in short order by, 'You know, I really hated stats in school.')"
