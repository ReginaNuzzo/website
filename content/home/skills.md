icon = "chalkboard-teacher"
icon-pack = "fab"
name = "Teaching"
description = "I started teaching when I was 13 (my classmates' parents paid me to tutor their kids) and haven't really stopped since. I currently teach statistics at Gallaudet University and summers at Stanford University, and I've developed courses and workshops for private companies and organizations on statistics, writing, and data communication."

[[feature]]
  icon = "pen-nib"
  icon_pack = "fas"
  name = "Science Journalism"
  description = "As a freelance science journalist since 2005 I've written about everything from penises to p-values, from humans' head lice to horses' nasal breathing strips, from the neuroimaging of criminal recidivism to the neuroscience of orgasms. A recent project involved teaming up with an artist to develop an illustrated feature about statistical issues in forensic science."



[[feature]]
  icon = "chart-line"
  icon_pack = "fas"
  name = "Statistics"
  description = "My Ph.D. is in Statistics, and I love how stats is both the gas pedal and the brake in the scientific progress machine. Most people think of statistics as just numbers, or formulas, or maybe even methods --- but I see statistics as a philosophy and outlook on the world. Statistics is like Journalism: Just like journalists find the story amid the facts, statisticians find the signal amid the noise."
  
  [[feature]]
  icon = "microphone-alt"
  icon_pack = "fas"
  name = "Stats Speaker"
  description = "I've given more than five dozen talks around the world on how we fool ourselves with statistics, what p-values can really tell us, how to communicate data in a human-centered way, and what journalists need to know about statistics. I've given several keynotes and plenaries for a variety of audiences. One of my most popular talks is titled _Five Problems with P-Values as Illustrated through Five Stories about Sex._"

[[feature]]
icon = "hat-wizard"
icon-pack = "fab"
name = "Data"
description = "I try to give my students -- and the journalists I consult for -- an appreciation for mucking around in the data.  I'm enthusiastic about modern tools for teaching data analysis and use R with Quarto and lots of tidyverse and real data. In my teaching I flip the typical learning process: We _start_ with the data and harness our natural curiosity to develop questions and hypotheses --- and _then_ we learn the tools to satisfy our curiosity. "


[[feature]]
icon = "assistive-listening-systems"
icon-pack = "fab"
name = "Bionic Human"
description = "I use a cochlear implant, which I've affectionately named \"Tiny,\" short for \"Tiny Brain Computer.\"  Without it, I'm deaf. I got Tiny as an adult, after I'd already been missing a sizeable chunk of my hearing since birth. So my brain has had to learn how to hear many sounds for the first time. Adult neuroplasticity is amazing. Curious? <a href=\"/ci-diary/\">You can read some descriptions here.</a> "
